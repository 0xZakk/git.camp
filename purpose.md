## About

Git camp is a collection of low-budget and low production quality videos aimed
at helping you up your git skills.

The knowledge and experience contained on this site is the result of *countless*
hours googling error messages and mysterious outputs at the terminal prompt.

Have something you want to learn more about? Confused about a particular
git-related topic? [Open an Issue](https://github.com/jshawl/git.camp/issues/new?title=post+idea) and tell
me about it.
